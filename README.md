# Project Setup Instructions

This guide will help you set up and run the React project on your local machine. Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your computer. If not, download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

### Steps to Set Up and Run the Project

1. Create the Vite Project:

   Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new Vite-powered React project:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```

   Follow the prompts to name your project (e.g., `my-project`) and select the `React` template.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

   After creating the project, change the directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd my-project
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:

   Install all required dependencies by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the Development Server:

   Finally, to start the development server, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Your local development server should now be running. Open your browser and go to the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to view your React project.
